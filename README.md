# Release date
The Release of this project will be on July 18th, 2021

# User Interface Design
For this project, there will be 4 different designs. Therefore, each one will be different.
## Why are there 4 different designs?
- The quantity of different devices is huge
- The responsive design doesn't apply when working with complex designs such as pacman arcade game
- In order to give a high-quality experience, the different designs are necessary.

## Sizes and specifications of the designs
### 320 Design
The first design was for the smallest size of mobile phones, the ones with 320px viewport-width.
The specifications of this design are the following:
- 12 colums of 24px each
- 20 rows of 24px each
- A border of 4px 
- In summary, 296px (width) x 488px (height)
